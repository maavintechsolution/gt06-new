This project is a Node.js server that accepts TCP connections from Concox GT06 GPS tracker devices, parses all types of GT06 data packets, maps packets to device IMEI, stores parsed packets as JSON in MongoDB per device, converts packets to human-readable format, and sends correct protocol responses to devices.
